<h1>Book reviews</h1>
<p> Over the years, my stack of books has grown. Hard to keep-up with what I felt while I was reading the books. Notion notes or any other notes-organizing app wasn't helpful either. Then came <i>Substack</i>!. What better way to keep track of that than writing detailed reviews, once I have finished reading. Following is the compilation of my reviews on some of the books I read.</p>

  <h3>Purple hibiscus: Perspective of a teenage girl on civil unrest and domestic violence</h3>
  <p>I found this book in a Boîtes de Livres in Switzerland. ‘Purple Hibiscus'’, the name felt like it is a fictional love-story and I almost did not pick it. But, then I read the synopsis...</p>

<h1>Web series reviews</h1>
<p> Over the years, my stack of web-series has grown as well. Hard to keep-up with what I felt while watching those series - the emotions, the politics, the thrill, the science! I started keeping track of my reviews through Instagram - soon grew out of it and then started to substack them!</p>

  <h3>Little Fires Everywhere</h3>

  <h3>Fleabag</h3>
  <p>What does being a feminist means? Is it just a few tick-boxes or something beyond? What if a woman is unapologetically not feminist enough as per societal norms?</p>
