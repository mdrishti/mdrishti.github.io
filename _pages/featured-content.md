        <h3>The one who believes in mentorship beyond research</h3>
	<p>Profile of Professor Nita Parekh of IIIT-H. I wrote this for the outstanding Rukhmabai Initiatives. She spearheaded the creation of one of the first focused Master's programs in the field and constantly updates the curriculum to keep pace with the rapidly evolving discipline. A key example is her insistence on including a shell scripting course, a practical skill often overlooked in biology education. Fond memories of the interview sessions with her and her colleagues. </p>

		        <h3>The good antibiotic</h3>
			        <p>A lot has been written about the pros and cons of antibiotics – lately, more cons than pros. Antibiotics, if taken when absolutely necessary and with complete dosage are beneficial. But, if taken in the absence of necessity and with haphazard dosage, the same antibiotics spread their wrath. How so?

Many antibiotics make little discrimination between the commensals– the usual and mostly harmless inhabitants of the human gut- and the pathogens– the uncommon infectious inhabitants. This leads to a wipe-out of most of the gut commensal bacterial population. 

You may think that the world is done with antibiotics while praying that an occasional bacterial infection resolves itself. Alas, this is not always the case and we have definitely not heard the end of antibiotics. Yet another antibiotic-diva -- the Lolamicin -- is in town! But this time with a twist that can save the commensals.

        <h3>Clingy Yeast: Perks of being tenacious</h3>
        <p>Ever heard of Chipko andolan movement? Back in the 1970s, people from rural north India clung to the trees throughout the Indian Himalayan region to stop commercial logging activities. Following the movement, the government banned commercial logging and deployed investigations into deforestation. Who knew that a simple act of clinging to trees can bring such a positive change!! 

Did you know that microbes can also become 'chipko' (clingy)? But the long-lasting impact of these tenacious microbes may not be so positive always, at least, as shown by a recent study (https://lnkd.in/dpNr8tPH).

Increased adherence to abiotic surfaces like plastic can drive a microbe's evolution. In an article on MicroBites I write about how yeast's ability to adhere to plastic can impact its virulence. 

These clingy microbes can use their clinginess to become even more clingy, filmy and filamenty!

        <h3>We need to reduce the energy footprint of microbiology research</h3>
	<p>Research labs worldwide produce around 5 million tons of plastic each year which harms the environment and our Planet’s health. While a lot of approaches to reduce, reuse and recycle lab equipment is practised, education for environmental integrity is still lacking. In this #FEMSmicroBlog, I discuss how microbiology researchers should set clear mandates for good lab practices to implement environmental integrity. </p>

        <h3>Microbes in stressed environments: to each, its own!</h3>
	<p>How different is gut microbiome in a healthy intestinal environment compared to the one in a stressed environment? A stressed environment can be an infected and inflamed intestine caused by a myriad of reasons.

In a healthy environment, several microbes depend on each other promoting cross feeding, whereas in a stressed environment, most microbes are left to fend for themselves. I wrote about this phenomenon in my latest blog at MicroBites.

        <h3>PCOS and gut microbiota on the body’s social media map</h3>
	<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects around 10% of women worldwide, although this number may be underestimated due to a lack of proper diagnosis and reporting. One of the most prominent areas of investigation is the link between this condition and the gut microbiome. PCOS symptoms can be unclear and difficult to study, even in animal models. However, scientists worldwide have made progress in pinpointing the role of gut microbiota in PCOS.

        <h3>A song of gut and bacteria</h3>
	<p>A little too crass for LinkedIn.... yet did you ever wonder why you eat, sleep, poop and repeat at the same time everyday? Your body's biological clock has a huge role in this cycle.
Along with your body's biological clock, there is another watch lurking around the corner of your gut. Read more about the symphony of these two clocks in my article at MicroBites.</p>

        <h3>Tale of a troubled microbe</h3>
	<p>These days, my favourite topic in microbiology is 'Auxotrophy'. During my PhD, I have found such fascinating shades of auxotrophic microbes! And what better way for me to understand this topic even more: I wrote about it on MicroBites . 

An auxotrophic microbe cannot make essential metabolites required for its survival. A recent paper (https://lnkd.in/exPEuvKc) discussed about how auxotrophic microbes can shape drug tolerance of an entire microbial community.</p>

        <h3>A probiotic cream to treat acne</h3>
	<p>Fascinating microbes! A recent study looked into the application of Lactobacilli for treating acnes. 

Are these bacteria naturally present on our skin? How effective are Lactobacilli against the harmful bacteria residing in the acne? How are they administered to the acne site? I discussed about these questions on MicroBites.

        <h3>Martyrs of infection</h3>
	<p>How does the 'inner skin' of our body protects itself from infections? 

The little cells on the inside of our intestine form this layer called epithelium. And looks like this epithelium has a mind of its own!

        <h3>Bitter-sweet resistance</h3>
	<p>An intuitive paper in Science Advances shed light on how microbes can modulate or even reverse their tolerance to antibiotics in presence of their peers. I wrote an article summarizing the paper at micro-bites.

Also tried my hand at illustrating the story through a nerdy-microbey cartoon!</p>
