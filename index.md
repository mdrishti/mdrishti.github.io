 <h1>About me</h1> 
  <p>I am a Biologist, with strong interests in Science Communication and Science Policy.</p>
  <p>My technical skills lie in the areas of computational biology, microbiome, and biodiversity knowledge management. For the past decade, my career has spanned working in multiple research fields in life-sciences. Over the years, my roles have changed - started as a Masters student deeply involved in Structural Biology, then a Researcher working on Metagenomics at TCS-Research, then a Doctoral Researcher exploring the evolution of a live vaccine at the University of Bern, followed by a short post-doc working on all kinds of microbial omics data.</p> 
  <p>Currently I am working on biodiversity knowledge management for the Earth Metabolome Initiative at the University of Neuchatel. Have a look at my Research publications and repositories.</p>
  <p>While I glide from one role to another, communicating Science and its impact has always been a parallel commitment. I have given presentations to school students, invited short talks to University graduates - also at my alma mater IIIT-Hyderabad - and written for popular Science blogs like FEMS microblog and Micro-bites. My goal is to reduce mis-communication in Science. Through my SciComm activities, I break down complex research published in peer-reviewed journals to digestible chunks of information - making sure not to dumb down the Science, but bringing clarity to the outcome of research to general audience.
