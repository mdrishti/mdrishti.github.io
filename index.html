   <h1>About me</h1> 
    <p>I am a Biologist, with strong interests in Science Communication and Science Policy. 
    <p>My technical skills lie in the areas of computational biology, microbiome, and biodiversity knowledge management. For the past decade, my career has spanned working in multiple research fields in life-sciences. Over the years, my roles have changed - started as a Masters student deeply involved in Structural Biology, then a Researcher working on Metagenomics at TCS-Research, then a Doctoral Researcher exploring the evolution of a live vaccine at the University of Bern, followed by a short post-doc working on all kinds of microbial omics data.</p> 
    <p>Currently I am working on biodiversity knowledge management for the Earth Metabolome Initiative at the University of Neuchatel. Have a look at my Research publications and repositories.</p>
    <p>While I glide from one role to another, communicating Science and its impact has always been a parallel commitment. I have given presentations to school students, invited short talks to University graduates - also at my alma mater IIIT-Hyderabad - and written for popular Science blogs like FEMS microblog and Micro-bites. My goal is to reduce mis-communication in Science. Through my SciComm activities, I break down complex research published in peer-reviewed journals to digestible chunks of information - making sure not to dumb down the Science, but bringing clarity to the outcome of research to general audience.

		        <h3>The good antibiotic</h3>
			        <p>A lot has been written about the pros and cons of antibiotics – lately, more cons than pros. Antibiotics, if taken when absolutely necessary and with complete dosage are beneficial. But, if taken in the absence of necessity and with haphazard dosage, the same antibiotics spread their wrath. How so?

Many antibiotics make little discrimination between the commensals– the usual and mostly harmless inhabitants of the human gut- and the pathogens– the uncommon infectious inhabitants. This leads to a wipe-out of most of the gut commensal bacterial population. 

You may think that the world is done with antibiotics while praying that an occasional bacterial infection resolves itself. Alas, this is not always the case and we have definitely not heard the end of antibiotics. Yet another antibiotic-diva -- the Lolamicin -- is in town! But this time with a twist that can save the commensals.

In a new article in MicroBites, I wrote about the latest research on this topic.</p>

        <h3>Clingy Yeast: Perks of being tenacious</h3>
        <p>Ever heard of Chipko andolan movement? Back in the 1970s, people from rural north India clung to the trees throughout the Indian Himalayan region to stop commercial logging activities. Following the movement, the government banned commercial logging and deployed investigations into deforestation. Who knew that a simple act of clinging to trees can bring such a positive change!! 

Did you know that microbes can also become 'chipko' (clingy)? But the long-lasting impact of these tenacious microbes may not be so positive always, at least, as shown by a recent study (https://lnkd.in/dpNr8tPH).

Increased adherence to abiotic surfaces like plastic can drive a microbe's evolution. In a new article @ MicroBites I write about how yeast's ability to adhere to plastic can impact its virulence. 

These clingy microbes can use their clinginess to become even more clingy, filmy and filamenty!

        <h3>We need to reduce the energy footprint of microbiology research</h3>
	<p>Research labs worldwide produce around 5 million tons of plastic each year which harms the environment and our Planet’s health. While a lot of approaches to reduce, reuse and recycle lab equipment is practised, education for environmental integrity is still lacking. In this #FEMSmicroBlog, Disha Tandon discusses how microbiology researchers should set clear mandates for good lab practices to implement environmental integrity. </p>

        <h3>Microbes in stressed environments: to each, its own!</h3>
	<p>How different is gut microbiome in a healthy intestinal environment compared to the one in a stressed environment? A stressed environment can be an infected and inflamed intestine caused by a myriad of reasons.

In a healthy environment, several microbes depend on each other promoting cross feeding, whereas in a stressed environment, most microbes are left to fend for themselves. I wrote about this phenomenon in my latest blog at MicroBites.

        <h3>PCOS and gut microbiota on the body’s social media map</h3>
	<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects around 10% of women worldwide, although this number may be underestimated due to a lack of proper diagnosis and reporting. One of the most prominent areas of investigation is the link between this condition and the gut microbiome. PCOS symptoms can be unclear and difficult to study, even in animal models. However, scientists worldwide have made progress in pinpointing the role of gut microbiota in PCOS.

Along with your body's biological clock, there is another watch lurking around the corner of your gut. Read more about the symphony of these two clocks in my new article at MicroBites.</p>

        <h3>Tale of a troubled microbe</h3>
	<p>These days, my favourite topic in microbiology is 'Auxotrophy'. During my PhD, I have found such fascinating shades of auxotrophic microbes! And what better way for me to understand this topic even more: I wrote about it on MicroBites . 

An auxotrophic microbe cannot make essential metabolites required for its survival. A recent paper (https://lnkd.in/exPEuvKc) discussed about how auxotrophic microbes can shape drug tolerance of an entire microbial community.</p>

        <h3>A probiotic cream to treat acne</h3>
	<p>Fascinating microbes! A recent study looked into the application of Lactobacilli for treating acnes. 

Are these bacteria naturally present on our skin? How effective are Lactobacilli against the harmful bacteria residing in the acne? How are they administered to the acne site? I discussed about these questions on MicroBites.
